  "kpi_descriptions": {
    "TSurf": "Surface temperature is critical for understanding heat distribution across different areas, helping assess thermal comfort and heat accumulation.",
    "WindSpd": "Wind Speed [m/s] - Wind speed. Vector sum over all 3 axis (West-East, North-South, vertical). Wind speed is essential for analyzing airflow and its effect on temperature and thermal comfort in the environment, impacting cooling and pollutant dispersion.",
    "RelHum": "Relative Humidity [%] - Relative air humidity (Caution: Depends both on Specific air humidity and air temperature). Relative humidity measures moisture in the air, which influences human comfort levels and environmental conditions, especially during heatwaves or cold periods.",
    "TMRT": "Mean Radiant Temperature [Â°C] - The composed radiative fluxes and air temperature for a standing person. Mean radiant temperature is a key indicator in thermal comfort assessments, representing the combined effect of radiation from surrounding surfaces on a body.",
    "T": "Air temperature is a primary metric for evaluating heat conditions, affecting both thermal comfort and environmental modeling in urban settings.",
    "TAirBiomet": "Biometeorological air temperature index provides insights into how air temperature influences human comfort, offering a detailed evaluation for urban planning.",
    "QLWSumAllFluxes": "The total of all longwave radiation fluxes, which helps in understanding the heat exchange between surfaces and the atmosphere, crucial for thermal balance analysis.",
    "QSWDiff": "Diffuse shortwave radiation measures scattered sunlight, contributing to overall radiation balance and its effect on temperatures and shading in urban areas."
